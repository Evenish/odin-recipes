        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe for a Vegan Vanilla Cake with Vanilla buttercream. Vegan food gets a lot of flak as it may be difficult for a lot of people to make right. Especially in Vegan Baking where eggs and butter are not used, cakes often turn out strange and very unlike non-vegan cakes.</p>

        <p>However, this recipe is a really good starter recipe as an introduction to Vegan Baking and especially to vegan cakes. It does not need any special egg substitutions, as it relies on baking soda and apple cider vinegar for the lift that eggs would normally give, and applesauce for extra moisture. The buttercream only requires a vegan butter as a butter substitute. This recipe will produce an elegant vanilla cake that tastes just as indulgent and delicious.</p>
