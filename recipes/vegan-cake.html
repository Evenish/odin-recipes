        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe for a Vegan Vanilla Cake with Vanilla buttercream. Vegan food gets a lot of flak as it may be difficult for a lot of people to make right. Especially in Vegan Baking where eggs and butter are not used, cakes often turn out strange and very unlike non-vegan cakes.</p>

        <p>However, this recipe is a really good starter recipe as an introduction to Vegan Baking and especially to vegan cakes. It does <strong>not</strong> need any special egg substitutions, as it relies on <em>baking soda</em> and <em>apple cider vinegar</em> for the lift that eggs would normally give, and applesauce for extra moisture. The buttercream only requires a vegan butter as a butter substitute. This recipe will produce an elegant vanilla cake that tastes just as indulgent and delicious.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>300 ml dairy free milk</li>
            <li>2 tsp apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>460 gr all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>230 gr sugar</li>
            <li>170 gr butter</li>
            <li>190 gr applesauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180C. Grease three 6" cake pans and line with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Combine milk and apple cider vinegar and set aside.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder and baking soda.</li>
            <li><strong>Make batter:</strong>Cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Add applesauce and vanilla. Mix until combined. Add dry ingredients and buttermilk. Mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Divide batter between three cake pans evenly, and bake for 35 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
