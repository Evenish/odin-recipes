        <div class="cake heading">Description</div>
        <p>This is a recipe for a Vegan Vanilla Cake with Vanilla buttercream. Vegan food gets a lot of flak as it may be difficult for a lot of people to make right. Especially in Vegan Baking where eggs and butter are not used, cakes often turn out strange and very unlike non-vegan cakes.</p>

        <p>However, this recipe is a really good starter recipe as an introduction to Vegan Baking and especially to vegan cakes. It does <strong>not</strong> need any special egg substitutions, as it relies on <em>baking soda</em> and <em>apple cider vinegar</em> for the lift that eggs would normally give, and applesauce for extra moisture. The buttercream only requires a vegan butter as a butter substitute. This recipe will produce an elegant vanilla cake that tastes just as indulgent and delicious.</p>
