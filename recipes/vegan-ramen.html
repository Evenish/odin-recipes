        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Vegan Ramen is as much of an umami-bomb as non-vegan ones. It's topped with a fried crispy tofu, miso-glazed carrots and baby bokchoy. Garnishing with green onions not only provide a nice bright green touch, but gives crunch and aroma, while chili garlic sauce adds a beautiful, mild heat to wake everything up.</p>
