# odin-recipes

This is the first extensive project in The Odin Project foundation curriculum. In this project, we are tasked to create a basic recipe website that consists of a main index page and will have links to a few recipes. It aims to familiarize one with writing the basics of HTML, such as the usage of link tags and images, as well as the syntax of the language. Once this project is completed, I will have demonstrated that I am able to set up a basic working website that contains absolute and relative links, proficiency in using the different HTML tags, and familiary with the HTML syntax.
